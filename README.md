# tkinter-gpt-chatbot
A chatbot I made in python using *tkinter* and *ChatGPT*

# How to use
* In the same directory as the *exe/pyw* file(s) you need to have a file called `api_key.txt` where your *openai api key* will be held. 
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* run the python script (*Windows:* `py main.py`, *Linux:* `python3 main.py`, *Mac*: **No, I will not and will never give anything for a mac tutorial**)
